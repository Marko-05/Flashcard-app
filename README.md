# Flashcard-app
A flashcard app that can help with learning a new language (currently in the app, the language is French, but with a few tweaks it can be any language).

When you click the green checkmark button, the word gets removed from the list of words to learn, and the remaining data is saved to the words_to_learn CSV file. Once you run out of words to learn, you can simply recreate the two columns ("French" and "English") in the data file and insert new words and their translations. Alternatively, you can download a different CSV file, but make sure to follow the format of the default file and rename it.
